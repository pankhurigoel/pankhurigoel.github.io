    <div class="mainheader" >I do not have any job experience yet. But, I have gained lot of experience during my final year project and other projects that I have made during my B. Tech. I have experience in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Also, I am learning various frameworks that will help me. I have recently learned about new version of javascript i.e. ES6. Also, I have learned about how to make a web page responsive with all possible resolutions. <br><br> I have worked with DRDO as a summer intern in 2017, there I worked on a project that helped user to get the changes made on a particular website to their registered email id for the given period of time. <br><br> I am a keen observer and is looking forward to work as a Frontend Developer.
